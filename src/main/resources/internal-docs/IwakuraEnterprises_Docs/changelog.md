# 1.2.0

### Major
- Rebranded to **Voile** due to bad naming. When searching for "hytale docs", there will be little to no chance to get this
mod in the search results. Also, Voile pays tribute to Patchouli, a great Minecraft mod adding documentation capabilities
as well!

# 1.1.0

### Added
- Improved developer API by allowing mods to just create assets that will be loaded by Docs.
This makes it super easy to add support for Docs!

# 1.0.0

The first release of Docs!

### Added
- The Docs' interface with powerful markdown renderer.
- Documentation system allowing users and developers to create documentations with ease.
- Command shortcuts allowing server owners to define easily accessible documentation.
- API for developers (accessible via class DocsAPI)
- Basic documentation for users and developers. This documentation will be extended in the future releases.

### Fixed
- Docs... not.. existing? They exist now :P

### Removed
- Removed Herobrine
